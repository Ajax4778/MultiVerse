## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: User Authentication, Poem/Stanza Models, JSON API
* BCrypt authentication and sessions
* Login page and basic home page after login (empty container, temporary logout
  button)
* Rails models for Poems, Stanzas
* API controllers for Poems, Stanzas

*At the end of Phase 1, users can sign up and login/logout.*   
When a Poem is created, it uses the contents of the "first_stanza" param to
create a new Stanza object.  
Poems and Stanzas cannot be edited after creation.

### Phase 3: User Focus and Page Style
* Persistent navigation: Home, Archive, New, Logout
* Changes based on current user
* Infinite scrolling implementation
* Basic cleanup of page design

*At the end of Phase 3, the poems are marked according to the current user.*  
The archive shows users all completed poems and users' contributions to each.  
The home page shows all incomplete poems; users can contribute stanzas to
any of these provided they did not the write the most recent stanza.  
Both the home page and the archive page have infinite scrolling enabled,
which reduces load time.
