## Minimum Viable Product

MultiVerse is a web application for collaborative poetry writing (based on the
  "Exquisite Corpse" method) built using
Ruby on Rails and React.js.

MultiVerse allows users to:

- [ ] Create an account
- [ ] Log in / Log out
- [ ] Create, read, and delete poems
- [ ] Contribute stanzas to poems
- [ ] Favorite completed poems
- [ ] Comment on completed poems

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: User Authentication, Poem/Stanza Models, JSON API (2 days)
* BCrypt authentication and sessions
* Login page and basic home page after login (empty container, temporary logout
  button)
* Rails models for Poems, Stanzas
* API controllers for Poems, Stanzas

*At the end of Phase 1, users can sign up and login/logout.*   
When a Poem is created, it uses the contents of its "first_stanza" column to
create a new Stanza object. "first_stanza" will also serve as a preview when the
poem is completed.  
Stanzas will keep track of their "last_line."  
Poems and Stanzas cannot be edited after creation, although Poems can be deleted
entirely.

### Phase 2: Flux Architecture, React views (3 days)
* React router
* Poem store, actions for create/read/destroy
* React components: Index, Poem, Stanza

*At the end of Phase 2, Poems can be created, viewed, and destroyed in the
browser, and stanzas can be added to poems.*  
Home page (Index) shows all poems created by or involving the user.  
No distinction is yet made between complete and incomplete poems, though users
still specify poem length on creation.
